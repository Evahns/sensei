# TinyTiny Multimodal

a tiny vision language model

## project goals

Build a high-quality, low-hallucination vision language model small enough to
run on an edge device without a GPU.

## moondream0

Initial prototype built using SigLIP, Phi-1.5, and the LLaVa training dataset.
The model is for research purposes only, and is subject to the Phi and LLaVa
license restrictions.

 **Usage**
Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/vikhyat/moondream.git
cd moondream 
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use the `engine.py` script to run the model on CPU:

```bash
python engine.py --image [IMAGE_PATH] [--interactive]
```

When the `--interactive` flag is not set, the script will predict three questions and try
to answer them.
